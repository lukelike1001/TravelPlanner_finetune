# **evaluation** folder 📂

tl;dr Contains evaluation scripts for TravelPlanner tests. Also contains **logs of previous runs** for both raw TravelPlanner and modified prompt-engineered tests using `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

## **Table of Contents: 📖**

### **Folders: 🗂️**
All output plans are JSON files. They are generally stored in subfolders named `validation-[MAX_BUDGET]` folders, and are either named `generated_plan_[TRIAL_NUMBER].json` or `generated_plan_se[TRIAL_NUMBER].json`. The `se` prefix stands for **"super easy"** 1-day plans, as "easy" plans span 3 days. Reflections are also JSON files.

- `previous_logs`: Contains previous output plans (and reflections, if applicable) from both raw and prompt-engineering runs using `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.
  - `1day_1person`: Output plans (and reflections, if applicable) for 1-day trips for 1 person
  - `2day_1person`: Output plans (and reflections, if applicable) for 2-day trips for 1 person
  - `3day_1person`: Output plans (and reflections, if applicable) for 3-day trips for 1 person
  - `7day_1person`: Output plans (and reflections, if applicable) for 7-day trips for 1 person
  - `raw_unedited_runs`: Output plans (and reflections, if applicable) for raw, unedited TravelPlanner validation test cases.

When running **[sole_planning.py](../tools/planner/sole_planning.py)**, the generated plan can be found in these two folders:
- `output`: The output plan generated by `sole_planning.py`
- `reflect`: The reflection(s) generated by `sole_planning.py` (if applicable)
