I should start by finding a flight from St. Petersburg to Appleton on March 19th and a return flight on March 21st. I also need to find accommodations, attractions, and restaurants for the two days. If the cost exceeds the budget, I should prioritize finding cheaper accommodations or flights. If the cheapest options have been selected and the cost still exceeds the budget, I should start finding cheaper restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nAction 1: CostEnquiry[{\"budget\": 2000,\"people_number\": 1,\"day\": 1,\"total_days\": 2,\"current_city\": \"from St. Petersburg to Appleton\",\"transportation\": \"Flight Number: F3574992, from St. Petersburg to Appleton, Departure Time: 22:51, Arrival Time: 00:42\",\"breakfast\": \"Mikata Japanese Steakhouse, Appleton\",\"attraction\": \"The History Museum at the Castle, Appleton\",\"lunch\": \"Swati Snacks, Appleton\",\"dinner\": \"The Millionaire Express, Appleton\",\"accommodation\": \"Cozy room + bright apartment + rooftop lounge, Appleton\"}]\nObservation 1: Cost: Sorry, the cost of your plan is 1420.0 dollars, which exceeds the targeted sub-budget of 1250 dollars. Find either cheaper accomodation or flights to reduce the total cost of the plan. If the cheapest accomodation and flight have been selected, and the cost of the plan still exceeds the budget, start finding cheaper restaurants. When creating your next plan, only change one attribute from your current plan. For instance, if you will change the accomodation for the next plan, do not change anything else, such as the breakfast or the flight.\nThought 2: The cost of the plan exceeds the sub-budget, so I need to find a cheaper accommodation or flight to reduce the total cost. I will start by finding a more affordable accommodation option in Appleton.\nAction 2: CostEnquiry[{\"budget\": 2000,\"people_number\": 1,\"day\": 1,\"total_days\": 2,\"current_city\": \"from St. Petersburg to Appleton\",\"transportation\": \"Flight Number: F3574992, from St. Petersburg to Appleton, Departure Time: 22:51, Arrival Time: 00:42\",\"breakfast\": \"Mikata Japanese Steakhouse, Appleton\",\"attraction\": \"The History Museum at the Castle, Appleton\",\"lunch\": \"Swati Snacks, Appleton\",\"dinner\": \"The Millionaire Express, Appleton\",\"accommodation\": \"Large Rooms with Bar and PullOut Prime Greenpoint, Appleton\"}]\nObservation 2: Cost: The cost of your subplan so far is 928.0 dollars, which tentatively fits within the budget. Now, plan restaurants, accomodations, and transportation (if needed) for the next day, using CostEnquiry[subplan] to ensure that subsequent days within the plan.\nThought 3: The cost of the plan is now within the budget after selecting a more affordable accommodation option. I should now plan the restaurants, attractions, and transportation for the next day to ensure that the entire trip fits within the budget.\nAction 3: CostEnquiry[{\"budget\": 2000,\"people_number\": 1,\"day\": 2,\"total_days\": 2,\"current_city\": \"Appleton\",\"transportation\": \"Flight Number: F3578689, from Appleton to St. Petersburg, Departure Time: 07:19, Arrival Time: 11:01\",\"breakfast\": \"Bliss Bakery, Appleton\",\"attraction\": \"Hearthstone Historic House Museum, Appleton\",\"lunch\": \"Parantha Gurus, Appleton\",\"dinner\": \"Peshawari Delux Restaurant, Appleton\",\"accommodation\": \"Large Rooms with Bar and PullOut Prime Greenpoint, Appleton\"}]\nObservation 3: Cost: The cost of your plan is 632.0 dollars, which fits within the budget.
