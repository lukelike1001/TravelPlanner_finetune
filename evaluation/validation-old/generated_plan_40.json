To mitigate this failure, a new, concise, high-level plan should involve validating the information for each day of the travel plan before attempting to calculate the cost. This can be achieved by cross-referencing the provided information with reliable sources to ensure accuracy. Additionally, the reasoning agent should have a mechanism to handle invalid or missing information and prompt the user for corrections before proceeding with cost calculation.\nAction 8: Finish[Day 1:Current City: from Sun Valley to San DiegoTransportation: Self-driving, from Sun Valley to San Diego, duration: 14 hours 9 mins, distance: 1,461 km, cost: 73Breakfast: Open Yard, San DiegoAttraction: Cabrillo National Monument, San DiegoLunch: Jetha Lal Ka Dhabha, San DiegoDinner: Burger King, San DiegoAccommodation: Spacious Room in Large 2 Bedroom Prewar Apartment, San DiegoDay 2:Current City: San DiegoTransportation: -Breakfast: Bikaner Sweets, San DiegoAttraction: Old Town San Diego, San Diego; Balboa Park, San DiegoLunch: Chaudhary Di Hatti, San DiegoDinner: Gopala, San DiegoAccommodation: Spacious Room in Large 2 Bedroom Prewar Apartment, San DiegoDay 3:Current City: San DiegoTransportation: -Breakfast: Bun Intended, San DiegoAttraction: USS Midway Museum, San Diego; San Diego Zoo, San DiegoLunch: Duggal Snacks, San DiegoDinner: Dabas Ke Special Chole Bhature, San DiegoAccommodation: Spacious Room in Large 2 Bedroom Prewar Apartment, San DiegoDay 4:Current City: from San Diego to ReddingTransportation: Self-driving, from San Diego to Redding, duration: 10 hours 10 mins, distance: 1,070 km, cost: 53Breakfast: Sunset Cliffs Natural Park, San DiegoAttraction: Turtle Bay Exploration Park, Redding; Sundial Bridge, ReddingLunch: Caldwell Park, ReddingDinner: Eaton House Museum, ReddingAccommodation: 3 Bedroom Cozy Apartment, ReddingDay 5:Current City: ReddingTransportation: -Breakfast: Turtle Bay Exploration Park, ReddingAttraction: Rivercrest Park, Redding; Shasta State Historic Park, ReddingLunch: Lake Redding Park, ReddingDinner: Shasta State Historic Park, ReddingAccommodation: Spacious Room in Large 2 Bedroom Prewar Apartment, Redding]\nObservation 8: The plan is finished.",
