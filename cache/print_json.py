print("\nThought 1: I need to plan a two-day trip from St. Petersburg to Appleton for an individual with a budget of $2,000. I will need to include transportation, accommodation, attractions, and meals within the allocated budget. I will start by looking for a flight from St. Petersburg to Appleton on March 19th, 2022, and then plan the activities and meals for the two days.\n\nAction 1: CostEnquiry[{\"budget\": 2000,\"people_number\": 1,\"day\": 1,\"total_days\": 2,\"current_city\": \"from St. Petersburg to Appleton\",\"transportation\": \"Flight Number: F3574992, from St. Petersburg to Appleton, Departure Time: 22:51, Arrival Time: 00:42\",\"breakfast\": \"Mikata Japanese Steakhouse, Appleton\",\"attraction\": \"The History Museum at the Castle, Appleton\",\"lunch\": \"Swati Snacks, Appleton\",\"dinner\": \"Bliss Bakery, Appleton\",\"accommodation\": \"Cozy room + bright apartment + rooftop lounge, Appleton\"}]\n\nObservation 1: Cost: Sorry, the cost of your plan is 1411.0 dollars, which exceeds the budget of 2000 dollars. Find either cheaper accomodation or flights to reduce the total cost of the plan. If the cheapest accomodation and flight have been selected, and the cost of the plan still exceeds the budget, start finding cheaper restaurants.
